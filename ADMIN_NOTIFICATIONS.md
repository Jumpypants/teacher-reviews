## Overview
The admin dashboard button now displays a notification badge when there are pending items that require admin review.

## Features

### ðŸ”” **Real-time Notifications**
- Shows total count of pending teachers and reviews

- Only visible to admin users

### ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Design**

- Positioned at top-right of admin button
- Animated pulse effect to draw attention
- Handles large numbers (shows "99+" for 100+)

### ðŸ“± **Responsive**

- Maintains visibility across screen sizes

### ðŸ’¡ **Tooltip Information**
- Hover to see breakdown of pending items
- Shows: "X pending teachers, Y pending reviews"
- Falls back to "Admin Dashboard" when no pending items

## Implementation Details

### Components Added:
- **`usePendingCounts.js`** - Hook to fetch real-time pending counts
- **CSS animations** - Subtle pulse effect for attention

### How It Works:
1. **Real-time Data**: Listens to Firestore for pending teachers and reviews
2. **Count Calculation**: Combines both counts for total badge number
3. **Visual Indicator**: Shows red badge only when count > 0
4. **User Experience**: Provides immediate feedback about pending work

### Badge Behavior:
- **No pending items**: No badge shown
- **1-99 pending**: Shows exact number
- **100+ pending**: Shows "99+"
- **Hover**: Displays detailed breakdown

### Performance:
- Only fetches data for admin users
- Uses Firestore real-time listeners
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Efficient re-rendering
